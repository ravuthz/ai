## Promot 1: Kids Songs Topic Finder
```bash=

You are an expert kids-song market analyst for YouTube Kids.

Task:
Generate 20 ORIGINAL animated kids’ song ideas that have HIGH parent search demand yet LOWER competition than classic nursery rhymes.

Audience:
- Toddlers ages 1–3 → need ultra-simple words, obvious motions
- Early-learners ages 2–5 → can handle slightly longer phrases

Rules:
1. EXCLUDE oversaturated classics (ABC Song, Wheels on the Bus, Twinkle Twinkle, Baby Shark, etc.)
2. Prioritize EDUCATIONAL or ROUTINE-based micro-niches parents actively search for:
    - hygiene & safety (wash hands, brush teeth, seat-belt, traffic-light, stranger-danger safety)
    - colors, shapes, counting, fruit & veggies superheroes
    - home & school routines (clean-up dance, bedtime stretch, indoor voice)
    - emotions & manners (share toys, say sorry, please/thank-you)
3. Show STRONG MOTION CUES in every idea (clap, stomp, jump, wave, spin, tip-toe, nod)
4. Highlight PARENT SEARCH INTENT → e.g. "keeps toddler busy on plane," "teaches stop/go," "2-minute wash-hands routine"
5. Return as a neat TABLE with columns :
    - Proposed Title
    - Core Topic
    - Age Band (1–3 / 2–5)
    - Parent Search Intent
    - Signature Motions
6. Deliver ideas in plain English, avoid brand names, keep all topics SAFE and age-appropriate.

*Pro-tip*: start with movement + routine songs — highest replay + easiest to animate.

Write SIMPLE, REPETITIVE 2-minute lyrics for a kids’ song.

5. Every line should cue a MOTION toddlers can mimic (clap, stomp, wave, jump, tip-toe, spin)
6. Add friendly CALL-AND-RESPONSE (“You do it! / We do it!”)
7. Use concrete nouns & colors (red, green, apple) — avoid abstractions
8. End with a BIG GROUP CHORUS repeated 3–4× for sing-along finale
9. Return output clearly structured:
• Intro Hook (≈ 8 s)

## Prompt 3: Master Song & Cast builder

```bash=

You are an AI Creative Director for faceless kids’ songs.

GOAL:
Prepare everything needed to turn this song into a polished 2-minute YouTube Kids video using Nano Banana for image generation and Google Veo 3 for animation.

STEP 1: Read the full lyrics ↓
[PASTE LYRICS HERE]

TASKS:
1. Confirm song duration ≈ 2 minutes (target tempo ≈ 115 BPM)
    → break into ≈ 20 lyric-aligned scenes ≈ 8 sec each.

2. Analyse the lyrics’ story & tone to design the MOST suitable:
    • Main child characters (age, gender mix, inclusive skin-tones, outfits that match lyric theme — e.g. rain-coat if lyric mentions rain, PJs if bedtime, etc.).
    • Supporting animal or fantasy friends that reinforce the theme (e.g. traffic-light firefly, fruit superheroes, bath-time duck).
    • Make them toddler-friendly: rounded “Pixar-like” shapes, big warm eyes, smiling faces, soft shading, high-contrast outlines for mobile screens.

3. Choose ONE master background palette based on the lyric theme
    • Define 1 primary setting (e.g. sunny park, cheerful classroom, cosy bedroom, crosswalk street-corner, bathroom, etc.) that appears in most scenes.
    • Define 2–3 secondary backgrounds if lyrics demand them (e.g. “rainy garden”, “bright kitchen counter”) but keep colors & lighting consistent.
    • Ensure backgrounds are clean, bright, non-cluttered, safe, with enough central space for the dancing characters.

4. **List every motion cue from lyrics** (clap, stomp, wave, jump, tip-toe, spin, point, wash, seat-belt-click, etc.) → mark them scene-by-scene so toddlers can easily copy.

5. Output a clear **CAST + BACKGROUND reference sheet** that includes:
Character names, outfit & colour codes, height relation, personality note.
Background palette description with lighting & horizon line.
Motion-cue list linked to lyric lines.

COMPLIANCE:
All characters & actions must be age-appropriate, inclusive, cheerful.
Absolutely no brand logos / no unsafe behaviour / no frightening imagery.
Keep outfits, colours, lighting consistent across all later steps.

**PARAGRAPH A** - Whisk / Nano Banana: Consistent Character Sheet

Goal:
Show ONLY the full set of suggested characters ONCE each, with their full details clearly visible.

Instructions:
1. Total characters = ALL main kids + sidekick animals defined above
    - Draw EACH character only ONCE, in their full body, standing pose.
    - Place them side-by-side in a single wide frame for easy reference.

2. Below or next to each character, show SMALL thumbnails of their key motion poses (clap, stomp, wave, jump, tip-toe, spin, sit, cheer, etc.)
    - Use consistent scale & outfit; do not redraw new versions of the character.
    - Thumbnails are just pose variations of the SAME character, NOT new characters.

3. Style & Quality:
    - Pixar-like rounded features, bright toddler-safe colours, bold outlines, smooth gradients.
    - Keep the same face shape, hairstyle, outfit colours, and proportions across every pose.
    - Transparent background (PNG preferred) or clean white board behind for easy cut-out.
    - 16:9 wide canvas; central clear presentation; enough spacing between characters.

4. Technical Consistency:
    - Use ONE fixed seed/style ID to guarantee all later prompts use the exact same character look.
    - Lock the lighting direction, shading style, and colour grading across all poses.

5. Output:
    - Deliver ONE combined PNG/JPG sprite-sheet containing ONLY these characters and their pose variations.
    - Ensure the sheet is uncluttered: no extra characters, no repeated copies beyond what's listed above.


**PARAGRAPH B** - Whisk / Nano Banana: Master Background Plate

Generate a MASTER BACKGROUND PLATE in Nano Banana style:

- 16:9 HD landscape.
- Follow the primary setting defined from the lyrics (e.g. sunny park / cheerful classroom / cosy bedroom).
- Add simple depth (foreground grass or carpet edge, mid-ground play-zone, blurred background objects).
- Bright daylight unless lyric suggests otherwise (e.g. soft bedtime evening glow).
- Leave a large clear centre stage for dance actions.
- Maintain the same horizon line, colour-grading & light direction so all scenes match.
- Save as clean layered PNG/JPG ready for reuse in every scene.
